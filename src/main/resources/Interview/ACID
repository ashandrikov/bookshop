Four key properties of a transaction

A - atomicity

    Entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all

C - consistency

    The DB must be consistent before and after transaction

I - isolation

    Multiple Transactions occur independently without interference

D - durability

    The changes of a successful Transaction save even if system failure occurs
